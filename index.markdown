Howdy!

I am an experienced software engineer who has worked and thrived in various domains. The meta-skills that has helped me are grit, coachability, curiosity and ability to assimilate information quickly.

Currently, I am in the last semester of my Master's in Computer Science at Texas A&M University and working actively in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
